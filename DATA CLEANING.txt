KEY NOTES
    1. No need to use GROUP BY as the columns are not in the select statement.
    2. IFNULL(NULL, 'execute expression') is used to display 0.
    3. As only using COUNT(*) will not display the value of 0.
    4. IS NULL is used for date_added and release_year as they are both date data types.
